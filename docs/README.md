### What I learned

This project really tested my CSS knowledge. I found myself spending most of my time working on the CSS component. I also learned that creating a seperate CSS file helps to keep things more clean. 

Concepts like border, margin, and padding were tested as well to make sure the design matched Frontend Mentor's example. My approach was a longer route and I began to understand there are more efficient methods to get the same end result.

### Continued development

This being one of my first projects, I'm going to be spending more time on CSS continuing. A lot of the problems I faced really just came down to lack of knowledge and experience which was reassuring. 

### Useful resources
